# Request for Proposal (RFP) for Wireless Infrastructure Deployment

## About Us
The organization “Robot Monkey” stands at the forefront of companies that work to improve both connectivity and operational efficiency. Our organization needs qualified vendors to build a wireless network infrastructure which fulfills current industry standards while optimizing network operational performance.

## Project Scope

### Objectives
- A dependable high-performance wireless system should be implemented to cover the complete office building.  
- The solution must combine without issues with the current wired network framework.  
- The company needs robust security systems that will defend data from unauthorized access.  
- The health system requires systemic monitoring support as well as service management.  

### Scope of Work

#### 1. Site Survey
- A site survey for network requirements assessment in the physical environment requires detailed measurements across the space.  
- The selection process needs to determine network access point locations which provide full coverage without signal interference.  

#### 2. Installation and Configuration
- Install The installation of wireless access points (APs) needs configuration for providing uniform network coverage.  
- The project will integrate with the current wired infrastructure to establish continuous communication between wireless and wired networks.  

#### 3. Security Implementation
- The staff must enable WPA3 encryption alongside MAC address filtering settings.  
- Implement secure guest network access and user authentication mechanisms.  

#### 4. Performance Optimization
- The network must support densely populated usage patterns while ensuring minimum delay occurs between requests.  
- The network requires optimization of its channels and bandwidth elements to function at maximum system efficiency.  

#### 5. Ongoing Maintenance and Support
- The company must perform regular software updates in combination with operating system security patches.  
- The network performance requires real-time monitoring which leads to instant action on detected problems.  
- Offer a service-level agreement (SLA) for issue resolution and ongoing support.  

## Requirements

### Coverage
- The office has 100% wireless coverage that extends to every area including all meeting rooms and common spaces.  
- Minimized dead zones and interference.  

### Capacity
- The network system should offer continuous performance for at least 500 simultaneous users.  
- The system should perform load balancing combined with bandwidth management to handle peak usage periods.  

### Security
- WPA3 encryption.  
- MAC address filtering.  
- Secure guest network access with separate VLANs.  
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for internal users.  

### Management
- The system achieves network monitoring and reporting tasks through centralized features.  
- Remote management and troubleshooting support.  

## Vendor Qualifications

### Experience
- The candidate requires at least three years of experience in designing and deploying wireless infrastructure.  
- Examples of at least two previous projects with similar scope and complexity.  

### Certifications
- The vendor needs to have two important certifications: network security and wireless infrastructure certification from Cisco and CompTIA and CWNP.  

### References
- The vendor needs to present references derived from similar projects performed by at least three previous clients.  
- The vendor should provide contact details and describe their previous work accomplishments.  

## Technical Approach
- Provide a detailed project plan, including hardware specifications and configuration details.  
- Outline testing procedures and performance benchmarks.  
- Describe how the network will be monitored and maintained post-deployment.
